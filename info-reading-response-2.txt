What is log data? 
Log data is a record of the past

What can we learn from log data? What can we not learn from log data? 
Log data helps us understand the past, in order to help predict the future. 
Despite this, log data will not give us exactly what will happen in the future, just a guideline.

How do log data and analysis compare to other methods we've explored (e.g. observation, interviews, surveys)?
They all use different methods to aquire data, but they use the same tools to analyze it.
