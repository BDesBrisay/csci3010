What is log data? 
Log data is essentially a recording of a past state

What can we learn from log data? What can we not learn from log data? 
We can learn lots from log data, such as meta stats, bugs, what exactly happened. 
Log data does not tell us what will happen in the future, but it can give us a general idea.

How do log data and analysis compare to other methods we've explored (e.g. observation, interviews, surveys)?
They all are different ways to gethere the information but they generally use the same analysis tools to interpret the data.
